**Submit your project proposal**

There are two tracks available for submissions to the San Diego CDS Undergraduate Conference:

### Track 1: Completed and Near-Completed Projects
- Submit an abstract of the project that you would use in your paper (about 150-250 words). *(Don’t worry about perfection. You can edit this for your final Summer submission.)*
- Submit materials you have already developed for this project.

### Track 2: Emerging Projects
- Submit a project proposal (≥ 300 words). This can be in bullet or paragraph form.
- Include a **Proof of Concept**, which should demonstrate feasibility. Examples include:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset you’re working with
  - Initial basic experiments
  - Demo or simplified simulation
  - Detailed analytical argument, perhaps including examples of similar projects



  When you're ready to submit your proposal, you can do so through [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rzDWWH-4ytHpyIjoJF7xkPvsrbebqWS-iH42dQ8ojOs/). It contains additional information regarding submission requirements, so plan time to fill it out. We look forward to seeing your contributions!
