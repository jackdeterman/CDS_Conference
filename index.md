Welcome to the **UCSD Computing & Data Sciences Undergraduate Conference** – a student-run event dedicated to celebrating and showcasing the creativity and rigor of undergraduate work in computing, data sciences, and related fields.

### What Is This Conference?

This is your chance to **publish your research, personal projects, internship experiences, startup pitches, or any niche topic you’re passionate about.** Whether you’re looking to:
- **Be Published:** Turn your ideas into a 2+ page IEEE-formatted paper.
- **Practice Public Speaking:** Present your work through a poster session or a 5–15 minute slide presentation in a low-stakes, supportive environment.
- **Network and Collaborate:** Connect with peers and faculty who are equally excited about innovation and research.

### Our Goals

- **Empower Undergraduates:** We’re here to give you the platform to share your work, get valuable feedback, and build your academic and professional profiles.
- **Encourage Collaboration:** By bringing together students from CS, Data Science, and other related disciplines, we foster a vibrant community of ideas.
- **Ensure Fair Recognition:** With a blind review process, we’re committed to a fair evaluation of all submissions, culminating in awards for Best Paper, Best Project, Best Presentation, and Best Demo.
